## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a social network that I want to create for testing my web-developping skills, I think realising a social network is the best things to test your capacities because it have many features to implements and many front end to create (I don't like this steps...)

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

- Download the repository by:
```
git clone git@github.com:pulk66-s/OnlyCringe.git
```
- choose your version (folder at the project root)
- please install projects dependecies (depending on which version you are choosing)

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites are dependings of the version

- RustVue
```
- rustc
- rust Rocket
- mariadb (NOT mysql it's important)
- vuejs

For dockerizing:
- docker
- docker-compose

For testing:
- python behave
- python selenium
```

### Installing

Installing depends on the version you are choosing but in each version (if I didn't forgot) you can found scripts to install.

But globally it will be scripts like this:
```
- You need to be on frontend or backend folder
./scripts/install.sh
(or docker)
./scripts/docker/install.sh
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Testing depends on the version you are choosing but in each version (if I didn't forgot) you can found scripts to tests.

But globally it will be scripts like this:
```
- You need to be on frontend or backend folder
./scripts/tests/launch.sh
```
If you don't want to launch all the tests you can found others scripts in ./scripts/tests

### And coding style tests

Coding styles are a major problem to keep your code clean. If you want to, just learn the basic coding style for the language you are using but there is some constants:
- choose between snake_case and camelCase and KEEP it
- classes are always in UpperSnakeCase
- 1 file = 1 utilities
and other things but I'm lazy so just know them

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Usage depends on the version you are choosing but in each version (if I didn't forgot) you can found scripts to tests.

But globally it will be scripts like this:
```
./scripts/launch/all.sh
(or docker)
./scripts/docker/launch.sh
```
